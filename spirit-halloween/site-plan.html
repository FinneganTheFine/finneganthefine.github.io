        There will be two types of people who come to my site, those who are looking to spread or expand their knowledge of the mysteries of Spirit Halloween and those who think that the site is a joke, a bit, a comedy gag, those who come looking for a laugh not expecting to be enlightened. What can my site visitors expect to find? They should be prepared to find a treasure trove of knowledge about spirit Halloween, they should come prepared to have their questions answered about where do spirit Halloweens come from, why are they here, and where they go. On this site visitors will be encouraged to share their spirit Halloween knowledge and experiences, as well as ask their questions about spirit Halloween. If you wish to make a contribution to the hunt for the truth of Spirit Halloween then you will only need to complete a few simple steps. Step 1, go to the contribution box. Step 2, add a username to the user box. Step 3, type your question of your valuable information pertaining to Spirit Halloween. Step 4, click submit when you are done to post you information or question. Visitors will come from far and wide to get this information on my site for one simple reason, that reason is that there is no other site that is doing this (trust me I checked before I made the elevator pitch). At the current time I am the only source of information that people will be able to turn to find out more about the spirit conspiracy, or conSPIRITcy, or to share their information about spirit Halloween.

      <h3>Information Board</h3>
      <p>
        Will be all the posts made, and will have sorting things for the main topics<br>
        One of the main subjects that my site is going to be focusing on is the mystery of where do the Spirit Halloween stores come from. They never sit there like most stores the building that they come into are empty the whole rest of the year, but when October rolls around the Spirit Halloweens just seem to pop-up, filling in those empty stores. What seems like overnight these once empty buildings fill up with giant displays, costume racks, computers, and Halloween decorations galore. But how do they do it? Another one of the main focuses of our site will be, “Where do the Spirit Halloween stores go?”. Have you ever seen a Spirit Halloween getting packed up? They just put everything on sale then two days later they’re gone, banner down, lights off, walls bare, just as if they had never been there in the first place. Has it ever left you wondering what happened to them? How they got out of there so fast? How they got out of there so quickly? They come and go like a specter in the night, almost like Spirit Halloween is a sort of Spirit of it’s own, possessing buildings all around the country but then when spooky season is over they have to leave so they put everything on sale so as not to arouse suspicion then they vanish back to wherever they came from to prepare for their return in another year. Finally, we need to bring forth what the true intentions of Spirit Halloween are, whatever they may be. We will use the community to piece together the mystery of what Spirit Halloweens purpose here on earth is. What is it that they desire? Why do they only open for one month out of the year? How do they appear? why do they appear? Why are they so expensive on things that normally wouldn’t cost much but are so reasonably priced on things that would normally be very expensive? There are so many questions to ask, and we need each other to find the answers.
