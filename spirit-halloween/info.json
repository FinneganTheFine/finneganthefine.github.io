[{"userName":"The Admin","userBlog":"where do the Spirit Halloween stores come from. They never sit there like most stores the building that they come into are empty the whole rest of the year, but when October rolls around the Spirit Halloweens just seem to pop-up, filling in those empty stores. What seems like overnight these once empty buildings fill up with giant displays, costume racks, computers, and Halloween decorations galore. But how do they do it? Another one of the main focuses of our site will be, “Where do the Spirit Halloween stores go?”. Have you ever seen a Spirit Halloween getting packed up? They just put everything on sale then two days later they’re gone, banner down, lights off, walls bare, just as if they had never been there in the first place. Has it ever left you wondering what happened to them? How they got out of there so fast? How they got out of there so quickly? They come and go like a specter in the night, almost like Spirit Halloween is a sort of Spirit of it’s own, possessing buildings all around the country but then when spooky season is over they have to leave so they put everything on sale so as not to arouse suspicion then they vanish back to wherever they came from to prepare for their return in another year. Finally, we need to bring forth what the true intentions of Spirit Halloween are, whatever they may be. We will use the community to piece together the mystery of what Spirit Halloweens purpose here on earth is. What is it that they desire? Why do they only open for one month out of the year? How do they appear? why do they appear? Why are they so expensive on things that normally wouldn’t cost much but are so reasonably priced on things that would normally be very expensive? There are so many questions to ask, and we need each other to find the answers."},

    {"userName":"The Spooky Scary Skeleton","userBlog":"I was doing some shopping at a store near my home just minding my own business, and literally next door to this store is a spirit halloween. It's 2 days after halloween and the store is still there but everything is on sale. It doesn't look like they've taken anything down at all, all theri displays and stuff were still up and running the shelves were all stocked so I didn't think anything of it. The next day I go back and the store is gone. The Spirit just vanished overnight, like it'd never even been there, there was dust and cobwebs in this empty slot in a strip-mall. No sign no banner no nothin, just one day it's there and the next it's gone.","postTime":1599175689},
    {"userName":"The Spirit of Spirit","userBlog":"They obviously just pack up everything that they don't sell at night then leave that same night. Honestly we should just be impressed by the workplace efficiency displayed by the stores and their employees.","postTime":1620175689},
    {"userName":"The Spirit Stan","userBlog":"I love Spirit Halloween so much. This site is so cool that we are able to gather here and just talk about Spirit Halloween and how amazing it is, I LOVE IT!!! Spirit is such an amazing store and they are able to do so much with the short time that their buildings stay open, it's honestly amazing how well the company does. Super spooky how the stores really do just seem to appear and disappear over night though, like they're a Spirirt! Oh My Gosh anyway thatnk you for looking at my rant as I ramble on. I love you guys! Byt Bye!!!!","postTime":1633175689}
